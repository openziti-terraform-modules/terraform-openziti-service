# Terraform Module for Managing an OpenZiti Service

This module creates a service with tunneler intercept and host configs.

## Planned Improvements

* Add support for creating a service with a custom host config
* Don't require dummy data for non-tunneled services, e.g., unused `intercept_address`

Please feel free to raise an issue if you have a request.
